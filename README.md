## Tracklog - React App
TrackLog is an innovative app designed to provide users with valuable insights into their Spotify usage patterns, accessible seamlessly on mobile devices. Although it doesn't directly integrate with Spotify's official API, TrackLog ingeniously leverages JSON data obtained from Spotify upon user request.

## What I've learned
This was my first app, and helped me learn a lot of new things like:

* **Component Reusability:** Understanding the concept of component reusability not only simplified development but also fostered a deeper understanding of React's component lifecycle and state management.
* **Functional Programming Paradigm:** Embracing functional programming principles through the use of array methods revolutionized the way I approached data transformation and manipulation tasks. Utilizing functions like map() and filter() streamlined code readability and efficiency.
* Building this app also served as a gateway to exploring the realm of UI/UX design, enriching my understanding of how design impacts user experiences.
